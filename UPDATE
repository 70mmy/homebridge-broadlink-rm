This release is pretty major. It's the first release since deciding to pursue Homebridge development full-time.

I'll be going through the issues raised in the last week shortly and shall be quick to respond to those of you who have any issues with this latest release.

After I've fixed any issues with this release I'll be getting onto support for retrieving temperatures from other sources.

### General
- I've laid the foundations for a new app for that helps you configure your Homebridge plugins. I'll be starting with this plugin and adding others. Stay updated by signing up to the mailing list. 
- I intend to keep working full-time on this and other plugins along with helpful Homekit-related apps so if you wish to keep the project alive, please help by contributing via Paypal or on Patron.
- Lots of fixes

### Code and Tests
- As the plugin is no longer just a small hobby project, the code has been re-factored so that it's easier to read, test and maintain.
- There's now 132 unit tests in place to help us confidently make amends without breaking everything.
- I'll be adding more tests as bugs are fixed in order to deal with any edge-cases. If I've broken something in this release let me know with an issue and I'll get right on it.

### Documentation
- The README has been updated to be much clearer.
- Errors have been fixed where necessary.
- Some previously hidden configuration options have been documented.
- Some configuration options have been renamed (though I've made them backwards compatible with the existing names).

### Auto-on and Auto-off
- All `switch*`, `outlet` and `light` accessories now support for `enableAutoOff` and `enableAutoOn`. 

### Ping IP Address
- All `switch*` and `outlet` accessories now support `pingIPAddress` and associated options.

### showV1Fan
- This option is now gone so if you're not on iOS 11 and use the `fan` accessory you'll need to use an older version of the plugin. Otherwise only Siri commands will work.

### Garage Door Opener
- New configuration options for `openDuration` and `closeDuration` are available. These replace `openCloseDuration` when provided.
- If you open the garage door and then close it before it's fully open the accessory shall now update to "Closing" instead of immediately showing as "Closed".

### Lock
- New `lockDuration` and `unlockDuration` options are available.

### Window Covering
- I'm happy to be corrected but I don't believe `sendStopAt0` and `sendStopAt100` serve a purpose any more so I've removed them. Let me know after in an issue if you still need them after this release and for what scenario.
- `initialDelay` is now documented. Checkout the README for details.

### Air Conditioner
-  `allowResend` and `autoSwitchName` were previously undocumented. Check them out in the README.
- `temperatureUpdateFrequency` has been added and allows you to set how frequently the temperature is updated.
